Fallhacks Hackthon Project

# How to Play
Download the ZIP file and unzip it then run the exe file. We didn't have time to implement the game over screen, so the game just freezes if you fall off the edge

# Controls
A and D or left and right arrows to move. Spacebar to jump, you can double jump. Shift to do a forward dash.
